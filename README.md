# Get Immersed in the Wondorous World of *Turing Machines*

## Experience life as a turing machine with features such as:
* moving right
* moving left
* reading
* writing

## Pretend to understand complex mathematic algorithms!
* adding
* subtracting
* satisfiability (maybe)
* the halting problem (*yeah, right*)

## Understand what it's like to be as powerful as a computer!
### *(but with significantly less RAM)*
